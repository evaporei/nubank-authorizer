# nubank-authorizer

Challenge for Nubank's Authorizer Code Challenge.

## Installation

To install the project you will need either `Docker` or `leiningen`. Also, all the comands that will be shown below will use `make`, if you don't want to install it, you can see what each one of them does on the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/otaviopace/nubank-authorizer/blob/master/Makefile) to run them directly.

### Docker

To build the image just run:

```shell
make docker-build
```

### Leiningen

Since just `lein run` will do the trick to run the project, if you want prior dependency installation, just like the `Dockerfile` does, just do:

```shell
lein deps
```

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    $ java -jar nubank-authorizer-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
