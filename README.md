# nubank-authorizer

Challenge for Nubank's Authorizer Code Challenge.

## Installation

To install the project you will need either `Docker` or `leiningen`. Also, all the comands that will be shown below will use `make`, if you don't want to install it, you can see what each one of them does on the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/otaviopace/nubank-authorizer/blob/master/Makefile) to run them directly.

### Docker

To build the image just run:

```shell
make build
```

### Leiningen

Since just `lein run` will do the trick to run the project, if you want prior dependency installation, just like the `Dockerfile` does, just do:

```shell
lein deps
```

## Usage

To run you just have to pass a file via stdin that contains JSON operations in each line. There are some examples on [`input_examples`](https://github.com/otaviopace/nubank-authorizer/tree/master/input_examples) folder.

### Docker

```shell
make run < input_examples/0_sample
```

The output should be:

```
{"account":{"activeCard":true,"availableLimit":100},"violations":[]}
{"account":{"activeCard":true,"availableLimit":80},"violations":[]}
{"account":{"activeCard":true,"availableLimit":80},"violations":["insufficient-limit"]}
```

### Leiningen

```shell
lein run < input_examples/0_sample
```

The output should be:

```
{"account":{"activeCard":true,"availableLimit":100},"violations":[]}
{"account":{"activeCard":true,"availableLimit":80},"violations":[]}
{"account":{"activeCard":true,"availableLimit":80},"violations":["insufficient-limit"]}
```
